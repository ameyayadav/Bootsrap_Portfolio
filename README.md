# Bootsrap_Portfolio

This project is a portfolio page showcasing my Frontend webpage design skills. Additional projects will be added in the future as my studies progress.

The webpage features a Bootstrap Navbar header, with my photo and name on the left, and three links on the right for navigating to the 'About Me', 'Work', and 'Contact Me' sections.

The hero section displays my slogan, while the 'About Me' and 'Contact Me' sections are in the same row.

The 'Work' section presents my projects in a grid format, using Bootstrap cards to give a brief overview of each project. Each card has a button that opens the corresponding webpage.

Lastly, there is a 'Skills' section that lists the skills that I have learned from the bootcamp.
